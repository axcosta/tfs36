Using and extending System.Diagnostics trace logging. 

Core library for Essential.Diagnostics, with a common base class for 
trace listeners. It also includes a generic formatter, a generic 
expression-based trace filter, and a file watcher for configuration 
changes.

Other Essential.Diagnostics packages extend the .NET Framework 
System.Diagnostics trace logging with additional trace listeners. 
Included are colored console (that allows custom formats), 
SQL database (including a tool to create tables), rolling file 
(with custom formats), rolling XML, email (per trace or batched), 
and an in-memory trace listener.

The Essential.Diagnostics project also publishes a fluent client 
library that includes easy encapsulation of activity and logical 
operation scopes, as well as abstractions and templated classes 
for a simpler logging API and support for dependency injection 
frameworks.

See the project site on CodePlex for examples and documentation.
