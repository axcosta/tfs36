A Discrete-Event Simulation Library written in C# using Three-Phase Technique

This is a discrete-event simulation (DES) library that uses the three phase technique as described by the works of K D Tocher and Mike Pidd.

A demo of library with a Critical Care Unit model is included as demonstration of library features.

Look also at the Documentation on how to use it.
